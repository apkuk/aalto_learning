## Overview & Requirements

### What are Custom GPTs?

Custom GPTs are tailored versions of ChatGPT that combine:

- Custom instructions
- Specific knowledge (uploaded files)
- External API capabilities (Actions)
- Specialized tools (web browsing, image generation, code interpreter)

### Requirements to Create GPTs

- **Subscription**: ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, or Edu
- **Note**: Free users can use GPTs but cannot create them
- **GPT-5 Migration**: GPTs will automatically migrate to GPT-5 equivalents

## Creating Your GPT

### Step 1: Access the GPT Builder

Two ways to start:

1. Navigate to `https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor`
2. Go to `https://chatgpt.com/gpts` and click "+ Create" in the top right

### Step 2: Choose Your Building Method

#### Option A: Create Tab (Conversational)

- Message the GPT Builder naturally
- Example: "Make a French tutor that helps with GCSE preparation"
- The Builder will guide you through the process

#### Option B: Configure Tab (Direct Setup)

- Manually set all parameters
- More control over specific settings
- Better for complex configurations

### Step 3: Essential Configuration

#### Basic Settings

- **Name**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: What your GPT does (appears in search)
- **Instructions**: Detailed behavior guidelines
- **Conversation Starters**: 4 example prompts to help users begin

#### Upload an Image

- Custom icon for your GPT
- Can be AI-generated or uploaded
- Appears in the GPT library

## Configuration Settings

### Instructions (Most Important)

This is where you define your GPT's personality and behavior:

```markdown
You are a French GCSE tutor specializing in helping students achieve Grade 9.

Core behaviors:

- Adapt explanations to student's learning style
- Use the UK GCSE curriculum framework
- Provide practice questions similar to exam format
- Give encouraging feedback
- Track common mistakes and address them

Always:

- Speak clearly and at an appropriate level
- Use examples relevant to teenage students
- Celebrate progress, no matter how small

Never:

- Give direct exam answers without explanation
- Use complex linguistic terminology unnecessarily
- Discourage students who are struggling
```

### Knowledge (File Uploads)

- **Limit**: Up to 20 files per GPT
- **File Size**: 512MB per file max
- **Text Files**: 2M tokens per file max
- **Spreadsheets**: ~50MB max
- **Images**: 20MB max

**Managing the 20-File Limit with Instructions**:
Since instruction files count toward your 20-file limit, organize strategically:

- **5-7 files**: Instruction protocols and teaching guides
- **10-12 files**: Reference materials (past papers, specifications)
- **1-3 files**: Reserved for updates and testing

Consider combining related protocols into single files with clear sections rather than many small files.

**Supported Types**:

- Documents: PDF, Word, TXT, Markdown
- Spreadsheets: CSV, Excel
- Presentations: PowerPoint
- Code files: Most programming languages

**Important**: Content from uploaded files may be included in outputs

### Capabilities (Tools)

Enable/disable these features:

- **Web Browsing**: Search and retrieve current information
- **DALLÂ·E Image Generation**: Create images
- **Code Interpreter & Data Analysis**: Run Python code, analyze data
- **Canvas**: Collaborative editing interface

## GPT Actions (API Integrations)

### What are Actions?

Actions let your GPT interact with external APIs, enabling:

- Data retrieval from external sources
- Performing operations in other applications
- Real-time information access

### Setting Up an Action

#### Step 1: Create OpenAPI Schema

Use the Actions GPT (`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TYEliDU6A-actionsgpt`) to help generate schemas.

Example schema structure:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Your API
  description: What your API does
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /endpoint:
    get:
      operationId: getData
      summary: Retrieve data
      parameters:
        - name: param
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Success
```

#### Step 2: Authentication Options

**1. No Authentication**

- For public APIs
- No setup required

**2. API Key**

- Simple token-based auth
- Key stored encrypted by OpenAI

**3. OAuth 2.0**

- For user-specific access
- Requires:
  - Client ID & Secret
  - Authorization URL
  - Token URL
  - Scope
  - Callback URL setup

#### Step 3: Configure in GPT

1. Go to Actions section in Configure tab
2. Paste OpenAPI schema
3. Set authentication method
4. Add authentication credentials
5. Test each action endpoint

### Important Action Limits

- 300 chars max per endpoint description
- 700 chars max per parameter description
- Request/response payloads < 100,000 chars
- 45-second timeout per request
- Custom headers not supported

### Consequential Actions Flag

Mark actions that have real-world effects:

```yaml
x-openai-isConsequential: true
```

This prevents "always allow" option and requires user confirmation.

## File Uploads & Knowledge

### How Files Work in GPTs

- Files become searchable knowledge for your GPT
- GPT can extract and reference specific information
- Supports semantic search across all uploaded content

### File Processing

**Automatic Processing**:

- Text extraction from PDFs
- Parsing of structured data (CSV, Excel)
- Image analysis (with visual retrieval on Enterprise)
- Metadata extraction

### Best Practices for Knowledge Files

1. **Organization**: Structure content clearly with headers
2. **Format**: Use markdown for better parsing
3. **Size**: Keep individual files focused and manageable
4. **Updates**: Replace files when content changes
5. **Privacy**: Don't upload sensitive or private data

### Accessing Files in Conversations

The GPT can:

- Search across all uploaded files
- Quote specific sections
- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Perform calculations on data files
